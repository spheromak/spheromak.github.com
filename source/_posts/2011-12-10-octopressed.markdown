 Posterous just doesn't support markdown very well, and every time I felt like writing a blog entry I would get frustrated. So after a couple people have expressed their pleasure with tools like [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using github pages.  I decided to give it a go.

I love this setup. I tried jumping in with [octopress](http://octopress.org/) without the rtfm. Having never setup github pages before i mucked up by creating a project site vs a user site, but once I fixed that (by creating a spheromak.github.com repo) everything clicked in.

Pulling old posterous posts down into [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) was simple, and now im off and running with real markdown blog. Backed by git, and I am happier for it.

So thanks [github](http://github.com), [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/),  and [octopress](http://octopress.org/)  for cool software that works
