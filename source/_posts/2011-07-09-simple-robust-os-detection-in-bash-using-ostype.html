title: Simple robust OS detection in bash using $OSTYPE
published: true
---
<p>I was using lazyweb to solve this problem. Google&rsquo;s results had solutions where people were calling all sorts of commands and parsing different files to detect system types. I didn&rsquo;t want to do a syscall. I wanted this solution to be as platform independant as possible. I only needed to know if it was linux/solaris/osx/bsd etc etc. Â Not version or somehting special. SImple enough. 1 minute of RTFM'n the bash manual turned up $OSTYPE and $HOSTTYPE</p>

<p>Man I love simple solutions!</p>

<p>P.S. First post!</p>

<p>P.P.S  posterious&rsquo;s syntax support sucks. took longer to figure out than this post did to write.</p>

<p>edit: converted to markdown  used gist for code highlight</p>
